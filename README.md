## Environment Variables
This project does not currently use environment variables. If needed, you can add a .env file for storing sensitive information and use a library like react-native-dotenv to load them.

## Troubleshooting
- Expo CLI not found: Install it globally using npm install -g expo-cli.
- Metro bundler stuck: Clear the cache and restart:
    `expo start --clear`
- Biometric authentication not working: Ensure your device supports biometrics and has enrolled fingerprints or face data.
- App not opening on a device:
    - Ensure your device is connected to the same network as your computer.
    - Restart the Expo development server.
